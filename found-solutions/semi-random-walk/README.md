Solutions in this directory were found using a semi-random walk method. In
particular, when transitioning between nodes, the algorithm will choose to
traverse streets which have never previously been traversed whenver possible.
When this is not possible, a street is chosen randomly. This method appears
to perform about 20% better than the default random walk method.
